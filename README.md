# Project introduction
*** 
This is a project created alongside with the course from Coder Foundry YouTube channel. Its main focus was to see practical use of JavaScript and familiarize myself with Bootstrap library. 

# Project focus
***
During the course, I decided to change coloring and logo a little bit, so that is why CSS rewrites some of Bootstrap styles, which I know is not a good practice. However, my main focus during that project was JavaScript: understanding XMLHttpRequests better, creating variables and functions, and displaying them on the website. 

# Topics covered 
***
- Bootstrap classes
- ajax and XHR 
- creating HTML elements JavaScript
- appending elements

# Possible improvements
***
- instead of XMLHttpRequest there could be used fetch
- search, most and least used words and document stats should be invisible when you open a page and show only after the book is chosen

# Conclusion
***
This project gave me a better understanding of how ajax programming works and how useful it can be. I also revised and strengthten my knowledge on functions and variables.
