This is a project created alongside with the course from Coder Foundry YouTube channel. Its main focus was to see practical use of JavaScript and familiarize myself with Bootstrap library. During the course, I decided to change coloring and logo a little bit, so that is why CSS rewrites some of Bootstrap styles, which I know is not a good practice. However, my main focus during that project was JavaScript: understanding XMLHttpRequests better, creating variables  and functions and displaying them on the website. 
What I covered during work with that project:
- Bootstrap classes
- ajax and XHR 
- creating HTML elements JavaScript
- appending elements
I find room for improvement in that project with the following things:
- instead of XMLHttpRequest there could be used fetch
- search, most and least used words and document stats should be invisible when you open a page and show only after the book is chosen

This project gave me a better understanding of how functions work and how important it is to plan ahead all the logic.
